# Syngas Composition Prediction with ANN  
### ðŸ”¬ Biomass Gasification Meets Machine Learning  

This project explores how **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** can be used to predict the **syngas composition** resulting from biomass gasification. The motivation was to move beyond purely empirical correlations and instead use a data-driven approach that captures nonlinear relationships between biomass properties, operating conditions, and gas yields.  

The work is built entirely in **MATLAB**, focusing on **symbolic modeling, training, and testing** of feedforward neural networks. The emphasis is on interpretability and performance â€” tuning parameters carefully rather than treating the ANN as a black box.

## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Inside  

### Core Data & Model  
- **Dataset (353 points)** â€” Compiled from reference papers, covering a wide range of feedstock and operating parameters  
- **Inputs (7 parameters)** â€” Biomass composition & process conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.)  
- **Outputs** â€” Predicted syngas composition (Hâ‚‚, CO, COâ‚‚, CHâ‚„ fractions)  

### Network Design  
- **Two-layer feedforward ANN** built in MATLAB  
- **Training algorithm** â€” Levenbergâ€“Marquardt (LM), chosen for its speed and accuracy  
- **Training strategy** â€” Multiple epochs with convergence monitoring to ensure stability

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights  
- How a **two-layer ANN** can approximate nonlinear gasification correlations  
- Why the **Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm** provides faster convergence than standard gradient descent  
- How increasing dataset diversity (500 points, 7 inputs) boosts **generalization**  
- Demonstrated that ANN can achieve **high-fidelity predictions** compared to experimental results
